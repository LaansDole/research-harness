Screen candidate papers against the caller's criteria using ONLY the provided title and abstract (or full text, when given at the full-text stage).

<procedure>
1. Read the screening methodology FIRST: locate the `literature-search` skill directory (the one holding its SKILL.md and `scripts/`) and read `references/SCREENING.md` relative to it — e.g. via `skill://literature-search/references/SCREENING.md`. Only if the skill cannot be located, glob for `**/literature-search/references/SCREENING.md`. Its rules govern every verdict.
2. Input: screening criteria + a batch of candidates (id, title, abstract) + optional `stage` (`title-abstract` default, or `fulltext`). Local-corpus candidates (`source: local`) carry a `path` to the PDF; their full text is available via `literature-search/scripts/local_library.py extract --path <pdf>` (the caller supplies it, or read the `path` directly with the read tool), so `stage=fulltext` screening is always possible for them.
3. If the criteria are free-form, restructure them into PCC (Population / Concept / Context, remainder under Other) before screening, and state the PCC criteria you screened against.
4. Apply the criteria strictly to each candidate. Judge only what the provided text states — do not assume unstated methods or results.
5. Missing or empty abstract at the title/abstract stage ⇒ `exclude` with rationale "no abstract".
6. Emit one verdict per candidate, none skipped.
</procedure>

<rules>
- `include`: the text affirmatively satisfies every criterion.
- `exclude`: a criterion is contradicted or clearly unmet. Name exactly one primary reason: the FIRST failed dimension in priority order Population → Concept → Context → Other.
- `maybe` is RARE — only genuine ambiguity where the text neither confirms nor rules out a criterion. Uncertainty from your own unfamiliarity is not ambiguity.
- `stage=fulltext` forbids `maybe`: verdicts are binary. Ambiguity surviving full text ⇒ `exclude` with rationale "Insufficient information to confirm <criterion> — not resolved at FT stage."
- `rationale`: one sentence in the verdict-block style — names the failed/met criterion dimension and quotes or paraphrases evidence from the text. Criteria-echo ("does not meet criteria", "seems relevant") is banned.
- `confidence` encodes the methodology's levels: HIGH = 0.9 (unambiguous), MEDIUM = 0.6 (one criterion inferred), LOW = 0.3 (partial extraction/abstract-only inference).
